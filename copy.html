                <p class="text-small">Adaptogens are herbal pharmaceuticals. They work to counteract the effects of stress in the body. 
                    Stress causes very real physical changes in the body, including harming the neurological, endocrine, and immune systems. 
                    Adaptogens have stimulant properties that help counteract those harmful effects.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Stress affects us all. 
            You may notice symptoms of stress when disciplining your kids,
             during busy times at work, when managing your finances, 
            or when coping with a challenging relationship.
             Stress is everywhere. 
             And while a little stress is OK -- some stress is actually beneficial -- too much stress can wear you down and make you sick,
              both mentally and physically.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> The first step to controlling stress is to know the symptoms of stress. 
                But recognizing stress symptoms may be harder than you think. Most of us are so used to being stressed, 
                we often don't know we are stressed until we are at the breaking point.</p>

               Rich in potassium, these fruits help reduce hypertension or high blood pressure. 
               Potassium helps lower the content of sodium in our body, 
               which is one of the main causes of an increased level of high blood pressure.
               Other than potassium, it also consists of high amount of calcium,
                which is good for our bones. Lack of calcium can result in severe bone disorders 
               like osteoporosis,
                but consuming black raisins daily in any form can help cure that.
