            Ashwagandha is one of the most important herbs in Ayurveda,
             a form of alternative medicine based on Indian principles of natural healing.

                which is good for our bones. Lack of calcium can result in severe bone disorders 
               like osteoporosis,
                but consuming black raisins daily in any form can help cure that.
